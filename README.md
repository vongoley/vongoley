- 👋 Hi, I’m @vongoley, or you can call me Allen.

- 👀 I’m interested in anything that is creative, amazing and exciting.

- Now I wanna develop an mobile app to make my some ideas come true, but I majored in psychology in university that just learned some statistic tools like SPSS; Therefore I’m currently learning lots of things that I need to develop my own app, including:
   - front-end programming(HTML5, CSS3, Javascript) to develop Weixin mini program;
   - backend-end programming(Python with Flask) to develop my web service;
   - Linux common operations to config my cloud service with Debian;
   - OLAP database configuration to store and analyse data from app.

- By the way, I'm now a data analyst in IT company, so I'm so good at SQL of OLAP, Data Processing with Python, use of BI tools(e.g. Power BI, Tableau); More importantly, I master most of knowledges that mobie IT business need, relating to product design, operation, growth, marketing……; And also I have much practical experience on these aspects. 

- 💞️ Only myself, it seems to be tough, so I’m looking to collaborate with some people to make good idea done, if we all accept these ideas.

- 📫 If you wanna talk to me anything about data work, China IT industry situation, app developing and so on,   
  I will be pleased that you could concat me with email(bowen.von@gmail.com) or Weixin(allenX2077)
